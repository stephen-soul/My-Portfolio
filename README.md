# My Portfolio
Hey, how's it going? I'm currently working through Nova Scotia Community College's Information Technology program in hopes of a future as a software developer. During my learning I've discovered that I love all things code. (This includes anything from android development to console Java work to C++ and Python and so on. One of the things I didn't think I'd have so much fun with was website developement but look at me go!) During my studies I've been tasked with making a portfolio to showcase my work and show off what I can do. Telling an employer what you can do is one thing - Showing them something and saying "Hey. THIS is what I can do" is another.

## What do I want to accomplish?
The plans for the portfolio is to design something that I can be proud of and showcase it in my own domain. I want to work on something to show off how far I've come, to show off what I can do, and also to show myself how far I've improved as life goes on as I intend to keep this up for awhile (time permitted.)

## What have I done currently?
So far, it's just the index.html and the index.css styled off of Larabel's main page. I intend to design it slightly different and add my own stuff as I learn more and get the time between assignments.

#### I'll update this readme as time goes on with the different things I want to add and my progress on those projects.
