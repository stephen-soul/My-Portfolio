# My Portfolio
Hey, how's it going? I'm currently working through Nova Scotia Community College's Information Technology program in hopes of a future as a software developer making desktop applications and games. I've learned a lot in the time I've been here and with each new thing I learn, I learn I'm hungry to learn more and more.

## What do I want to accomplish?
The plans for the portfolio is to design something that I can be proud of and showcase it in my own domain. I want to work on something to show off how far I've come, to show off what I can do, and also to show myself how far I've improved as life goes on as I intend to keep this up for awhile (time permitted.)

## What have I done currently?
So far, it's mainly ideas as I work on school projects and projects of my own. I will add each of them as I can. I have, however, learned a lot more about github and getting it to work with a linux terminal, so my progress should be furthered.

#### I'll update this readme as time goes on with the different things I want to add and my progress on those projects.
